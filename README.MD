# 🎶 AI Music Generator 🎤🎸

## 💡 Idea Generation

I was inspired by how **musicians create songs** — first they **write lyrics**, then create **background music**, and finally **mix vocals** with instruments.

This project **mirrors that philosophy**, but with the power of **Generative AI** — automating the entire music creation pipeline.

Generate complete songs using AI — from **lyrics** to **vocals**, **background music**, and **final mix** — all in one pipeline.

Powered by:
- 🔥 Mistral (fine-tuned) for **lyric generation**
- 🎧 MusicGen for **instrumental audio**
- 🗣️ Bark for **vocal synthesis**
- 🎛️ PyDub for **audio mixing**
- ⚙️ FastAPI for backend API
- 🖼️ Streamlit for interactive frontend

## 🚀 Features

- Generate lyrics based on **genre**, **instruments**, and **mood**
- Convert lyrics into vocals using **text-to-speech**
- Compose background music matching theme and instruments
- Overlay vocals and music into a professional-sounding **final song**
- Export as `.mp3` or `.wav`
